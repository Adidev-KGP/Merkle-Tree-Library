# Project Description

There are many devices which have very limited storage and in-computation memory.
For example Hardware Wallets(HWWs) which are security devices to protect cryptographic keys because of the constraints in embedded development, have hard constraints on the amount of resources (computation, RAM, storage) available in these settings.

A solution is for devices such as the HWW to outsource holding this data to an external and more powerful device (the client), like the laptop connected to the HWW. But the client could be compromised by malware, and therefore could attempt an attack on the HWW or its user by feeding wrong or outdated information.
Merkle trees allow to make this approach safe, by producing a short commitment to the entire outsourced data. Every access request from the HWW is responded to by the client with the requested data, plus a short proof that the data is indeed correct. The HWW acts as a verifier by checking each proof before making use of any response, and will refuse to proceed on a verification failure.

Merkle trees can easily represent static arrays/lists. Updatable lists are also possible with dynamic Merkle trees; in this model, the HWW could request to update a certain element of the array, or to append a new element at the end of the list; the client would reply with the new Merkle root, and a correctness proof of the update that the HWW is able to verify.

So basically if the HWW is to get some data from the client it can receive it but to be sure that the correct data has been served to it a merkle proof is sent and using the hash of data and merkle proof HWW can verify if the data it has been sent is correct or not.

If you don't know much about Merkle Trees and Merkle Proofs you can read this

# Aim of the Project

- Maintian a library that can run in devices like hardware wallets to run the role of the verifier for the outsourced data. Current implementation is in C.

- This project aims to maintain a  standalone library for the client to produce Merkle trees, produce proofs, update a leaf by its index while producing a proof of correct update.

# About the Project

This project has 2 separate libraries:
- Pyhton library(Porver)
- C library(Verifier)

## Properties of Python library(Prover) 
- Produce a Merkle Tree from a given list of hashes
- Replace a particular leaf index with another value and produce proof of correct update(set() method of class MerkleTree in merkle.py)
- Produce Merkle Proof for a particular index.

## Properties of C library(Verifier)
- To verify using the data hash and merkle proof that the data sent to it is correct.
- It can give instructions to the Prover to replace a particular data/leaf with another one.

## Folder structure
- Python library (prover/merkle.py)
- C library (verifier/verifier.c)
- Unit tests for Python library (tests/test_Prover)
- Unit tests for C library (tests/test_Verifier)
- Integration of Python library (integration/client.py)
- Integration of C library (integration/server.c)

- #### [integration/README.md](https://github.com/Adidev-KGP/Merkle-Tree-Library/tree/main/integration)

## Building and running the Integration

Activate the verifier using the following commands.
``` 
~/Merkle-Tree_Library$ make
~/Merkle-Tree_Library$ ./a.out
```
Activate the prover using the following commands on a different terminal if you are on the same system.
```
~/Merkle-Tree_Library$ python3 ./integration/client.py
```
Once both the verifier and the prover have been activated you can start the communication between them.

Let me show you a demonstration of communication(prover starts the communication)

### Instructions to run the Integration

- Start the communication from the Prover's side

- The verifier can only give two queries to which the Prover will respond with data:

query 1:

```get <index_of_leaf>```

Example:

```get 3 ```


This instruction fetches the verifier the hash of the leaf with index x along with merkle proof and other data so that it can verify the data received by it.

Demo:

```
get 3

Verified! The data sent is correct

```

query 2:

```set <index_of_leaf> <value> <Datatype>```

Example:

```set 3 crypto string```

This instruction fetches the verifier the proof of correct update after replacing the old leaf at index <index> with the <value>.

Demo:

```
set 3 45 int

Verified! The data sent is correct
```

Other instructions maybe:

```set 4 github string```

```set 7 football string```

- To end the communication press B on the Verifier's side.

To know about how data is sent to verifier and other in-depth things refer to  
#### [integration/README.md](https://github.com/Adidev-KGP/Merkle-Tree-Library/tree/main/integration).

## Building and running unit-tests

You will find the unit tests for Prover and Verifier in 
#### [tests/test_Prover](https://github.com/Adidev-KGP/Merkle-Tree-Library/tree/main/tests/test_Prover) 
and 
#### [tests/test_Verifier](https://github.com/Adidev-KGP/Merkle-Tree-Library/tree/main/tests/test_Verifier) respectively. 

### Running the Prover's unit-tests:

Run the tests separately:

To run the tests separately use the following command:

```pytest -m <marker_name>```
```

Example:

pytest -m ceil_lg --disable-warnings

Owner:~/Merkle-Tree_Library$ pytest -m ceil_lg --disable-warnings

============================ 1 passed, 10 deselected, 11 warnings in 0.54s ============================

```
You will find the marker names in the tests/test_Prover/ folder and in each .py file there are functions which start with test_
Above the definition of function prototype marker names are given 

Eg:

inside tests/test_Prover/test_cls_merkle.py you will find the following on line 167 and 168

```
@pytest.mark.set
def test_set():
```

Here ```set```is the marker name of ```test_set()``` function.

So to run test_set() we give the following command:
```
pytest -m set --disable-warnings

Demo:

Owner:~/Merkle-Tree_Library$ pytest -m set --disable-warnings

# Further Work

The project is open-source. There are many extensions to this project like adding the feature to add new leaf to the Merkle Tree OR sending data to the verifier as buffer to minimize the memory storage.

Thanks for the patience :)
