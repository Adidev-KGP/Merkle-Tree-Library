# Integration of C and python libraries

Both the libraries are currently able to communicate using sockets over TCP/IP stack on port ```4455```. But there can be many modifications in this case and we may implement them in the future as well.

## Flow of communication
- The Prover is started
- The verifier is started
- Now the connection is established
- The first message is sent by the prover to verifier
- Now the verifier can message or query the prover. Regarding the query please read the main README.md on home page of repository. It covers the queries with examples and demonstrations.
- Prover responds to the queries with relevant information.
- To close the communication the verifier pressed ```B```.

## Data Transfer format and its processing

### QUERY : get

For the query of format ```get <index>``` the prover responds with a string having the following informations separated by a space
- size of Merkle Tree
- index
- Size of Merkle Proof
- Root hash
- Leaf hash
- Merkle Proof

On terminal it looks as follows:

```
get 3

To extract all this information from a single string ```parse_get()``` function defined in ```server.c``` in used.

The length of the whole string is safely less than ```270*70``` or ```18900``` because we are using sha256 as the hash function and there can be a total of only ```2^256``` sha256 hashes each of length ```64``` in hexadecimal format. So here we get ```256*64```. Also leaf hash and root hash are there in the string therefore the exact length can be considered to be ```258*64```. Since there are spaces and integers which will be less than or equal to ```2^256``` since they are size of Merkle tree, index which is but obvious less than size of Merkle Tree and size of proof which is log of size of Merkle Tree.
So it is totally safe if we consider ```18900``` as the maximum length of string though this is also much greater than the actual string can ever be.

Since each element of the string is a standard ASCII value therefore each string element is 1 byte. So the maximum size of string that is sent to verifier is 18900 bytes or approximately ```18.5 MB```.

### QUERY : set

For the query of format ```set <index> <value> <data_type>``` the prover responds with a string having the following informations separated by a space
- size of Merkle Tree
- index
- Size of Merkle Proof
- Old root hash
- Old leaf hash
- New root hash
- New leaf hash
- Merkle Proof

On terminal it looks as follows:
